## 1. Goat & Farm Economy

### The Economic Thesis Behind GoatX

For thousands of years, livestock formed the backbone of human wealth. Families, tribes, and civilizations grew through animals that reproduced, provided food, and generated continuous economic value.

GoatX modernizes this ancient system by combining livestock economics with blockchain verification, transforming biological production into a globally accessible, auditable, real-world asset (RWA).

Nature does not default.  
It multiplies.

## 2. How GoatX Works

GoatX is structured around three core components:

- **GTX** — Ownership & ecosystem access  
- **GPX** — Event-based real yield  
- **GVC** — Predictable value release (non-ROI)

Detailed protocol flow will be expanded in subsequent sections.
